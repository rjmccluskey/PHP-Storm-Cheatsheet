Shortcut | Description
--- | ---
`Ctrl + N` | lookup a class
`Ctrl + Shift + N` | lookup a file
`Ctrl + Shift + Alt + N` | lookup a symbol
`Ctrl + B` | goto declaration/definition
`Shift + F2` | goto declaration/definition
`Ctrl + F12` | list all members of a class
`Alt + Shift + F7` | find all usages
`Alt + Enter` | show suggestions
`Alt + F1` | context menu
`Shift + F6` | rename refactor
`F6` | move class to new file refactor
`Ctrl + Shift + Alt + T` | 'refactor this' tool
`Ctrl + Shift + F` | global find
`Ctrl + Q` | show quick documentation
`Ctrl + Shift + T` | create or find unit test
`Ctrl + Shift + F10` | dynamic run configuration
`Ctrl + W` | select whole word
`Ctrl + Shift + A` | get list of actions
`Shift + F2` | goto function definition
`Ctrl + Tab (Ctrl + [0-9A-Z])` | show available tools to jump to (then pick one)
`Ctrl + F5` | run normal
`Alt + F5` | run debug
`Alt + Insert` | in file window: insert file OR in editor window: insert predefined items (i.e. docs, test method, getters and setters)
`Ctrl + Alt + V` | set expression to interim variable, and then use interim variable the next line (really hard to explain, but it's really useful)
`Alt + J` | spawn new cursor at next instance of word under cursor, really useful for refactoring non-variable strings (i.e. array keys)
`F10` | step over line (debug tool)
`F11` | step into function (debug tool)

There is also an action to 'clear all tabs' and to 'clear all unedited tabs' that I use a lot, but it's not defined by default.  I find assigning them to a hotkey definitely saves time in clearing your workspace (I used Ctrl + Shift + Backspace and Ctrl + Alt + Backspace, respectively).
